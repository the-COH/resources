# Contributing to The Canto Online Hackathon Resources

This repository is an open initiative to crowdsource resources for Canto, the [layer one blockchain powered by Free Public Infrastructure](https://github.com/Canto-Network/Canto). It was primarily created with [Canto Online Hackathon](https://thecoh.build/) builders in mind, but is available to all Canto contributors, builders, and community members.

With this spirit in mind, the community is invited to collaborate to this resource, with no strict guidelines enforced on content or form. Basic information on what and how to contribute is outlined below.
